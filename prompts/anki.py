%Sample Text
The kidneys are responsible for regulating HCO3- levels. They can excrete HCO3-, but under most normal dietary conditions they are net producers of HCO3-. This is because HCO3- production is required to buffer urine pH to allow for pH regulation. Net production of HCO3- requires:
1) Reabsorption of filtered HCO3-.
2) Production of HCO3- and H+ in the proximal tubule…
3) …allowing secretion of H+ and the return of HCO3- to the plasma.
4) Buffering of tubular H+ to allow further secretion.
5.3.i – Reabsorption of HCO3-
Reabsorption of HCO3- in the different segments of the nephron. The majority of HCO3-
is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, and usually all of the remainder is reabsorbed in the later
segments. In alkalosis, some reduction in HCO3- reabsorption occurs, and HCO3- secretion is possible from the Type B (base-secreting) intercalated cells of the distal tubule, allowing excretion of HCO3-.
In all segments, HCO3- is reabsorbed by:
1) Secretion of H+, acidifying the tubule.
2) This drives the reaction HCO3-+H+CO2+H2O to the right.
3) The CO2 diffuses into the cell, as it is membrane permeable.
4) The cell is more alkaline, due to secretion of H+. The reaction is driven back
to the left, yielding HCO3- and H+.
5) HCO3- is then transported out of the cell across the basolateral membrane
by a variety of mechanisms, and the H+ is secreted, restarting the cycle

The text will be medical in nature, so you will act as a medicine expert. For a given sample of text, you are to return as many Blocks as you can make without making Blocks that have the same meaning. Each Block consists of a segment of text you will copy from the sample as well as your choice of what type of card to convert this sample into. You may make Blocks with the same segment of text.

% Types of cards
Fact Card
Fact cards are best created for isolated facts in the text. For example, this could be the definition of a term, or the name of a compound used in a certain medical test. Cover as many of the isolated facts in the text as possible using Fact Cards. However, each Fact Card should not contain much information, so generally you should only select one sentence or less for the Block. Label this Block with “Type: Fact Card” after the sample text.

Example of generating a Block for a Fact card:
Input Sample: On the other hand, if capillary pressures are low (after severe haemorrhage, for example), the Startling forces may favour movement from the interstitium into the capillary, a process sometimes called autotransfusion.
Your Output:

Type: Fact Card


Concept Card
Concept cards are best created to highlight a deeper concept explained in the text. You will typically create concept cards from parts of the text where a concept is explained, or the explanation for why a certain phenomenon occurs is given. Concept cards may contain more detail than Fact cards, but you should still keep them concise.

Example of generating a Block for a Concept card:
Input Sample: Thus, ions such as Na+, K+, Cl- etc. do not exert an osmotic pressure across the capillary membrane. Even though these ions are present at high concentration in plasma (e.g.
normal plasma contains 142 mmol l-1 [Na+]), their concentrations in the interstitial
fluid are similar because they freely cross the capillary membrane.
Your Output:

Type: Concept Card

Note: Here we decide to omit the description of the ions being at 142 mmol concentration, as the card should be concise.


Cloze Overlapper
Cloze Overlapper cards are best used when the text describes either a process (for example, what occurs in the first week of embryo development), or a set of attributes (for example, all of the adverse effects of hypertension). To create a Cloze Overlapper card, create a Block containing the text in the sample that describes the process or set of attributes. Label this Block with “Type: Cloze Overlapper” after the sample text.

Example of generating a Block for a Cloze Overlapper card:
Input sample: Blood enters the kidneys at the renal hilum (5) through the renal arteries (3). These are large arteries, reflecting the fact that the kidneys receive an enormous 25% of the resting cardiac output, even though they constitute only about 2% of total body weight in humans.
The renal artery divides into the interlobar arteries running up the renal columns (10) to the junction between the renal cortex (light brown shading) and the medulla (the inner region, shaded darker brown, and divided into pyramids (1)). These feed arcuate arteries which run along the cortico- medullary border and branch into interlobular arteries (2). These supply the cortex via the afferent arterioles. These lead to the glomerular capillaries, where filtration takes place

ultrafiltration_sample_text = """The three layers of the filtration barrier have slightly different roles:
(1) The fenestrated capillary membrane. This has large pores (~70 nm) that
entirely prevent the passage of cells (erythrocytes are ~7 m in diameter) but
allows passage of even the largest protein molecules.
(2) The basement membrane. This is the shared basement membrane of the
glomerular capillary membrane and the podocytes lining Bowman’s capsule. It
is negatively charged, and restricts the passage of large solutes.
(3) The podocytes. These have foot processes separated by filtration slits bridged
by a thin diaphragm with pores approximately 4 by 14 nm. This is the most
restrictive layer of the filtration barrier, and also carries a negative charge.
These three layers completely prevent the passage of molecules larger than about 4
nm in diameter, and restrict the passage of molecules that are between approximately
2 to 4 nm. Thus water and all the inorganic solutes in the plasma (Na+, K+, Cl- etc.) pass
freely through the filter as their diameters are considerably less than 1 nm. The
smallest plasma protein, albumin, is approximately 3.5 nm in diameter, but because
both albumin and the filtration barrier are negatively charged, very little albumin is
able to pass into Bowman’s capsule. Note that the charge on the filtration barrier is
irrelevant to smaller molecules because charges must be close to interact, and only
larger molecules have to pass sufficiently close to the borders of the filtration barrier."""

liver_anatomy_sample_text = """The liver, the largest gland in the body, weighs 1.5kg and receives 1,500ml of blood per minute. It lies under the costal margin in the right hypochondrium and extends over to the left hypochondrium. In a
preserved cadaver, it is firm and hardened, but in life it is a red, highly vascular and soft organ.
Its functions are to produce bile for secretion into the duodenum; to metabolise, monitor and
maintain blood glucose; to synthesise proteins, amino acids and lipids; to store minerals; to store and
synthesise some vitamins; and to detoxify drugs, toxins and hormones.
Ligaments
There are five ligaments associated with the liver, of which four are peritoneal folds.
• the falciform ligament, a double peritoneal fold which is attached to the diaphragm and
anterior abdominal wall from the umbilicus
• the right and left triangular ligaments, which run from the sides of the diaphragm to the
posterior border of the liver
• the coronary ligament, which is continuous with the right triangular ligament, and attaches the
right lobe of the liver to the diaphragm
• the ligamentum teres, the obliterated left umbilical vein which is contained within the free edge
of the falciform ligament
• the ligamentum venosum, which lies between the left and caudate lobes of the liver, and
contains the obliterated ductus venosus
The bare area is devoid of peritoneum. It lies against the diaphragm and posterior abdominal wall and
is in contact with the inferior vena cava and right adrenal gland.
Lobes
Descriptively, the liver is divided into right and left lobes by the fissure for ligamentum teres on the
inferior surface and posteriorly by the fissure for the ligamentum venosum.
The right lobe contains the porta hepatis and the fissure for the inferior vena cava, and is subdivided
into the quadrate lobe between the ligamentum teres and gall bladder, and the caudate lobe lying
between the fissures for the inferior vena cava and ligamentum venosum. The caudate lobe is
connected to the right lobe by the caudate process. The fossa for the gall bladder lies on the inferior

The secretion of pepsinogens from chief cells is promoted by
vagal ACh and a cholinergic reflex in response to acidity. Acidity
catalyzes the cleavage of inactive pepsinogens to form
pepsins, enzymes which digest proteins and peptides, and HCl
also provides the low pH environment (pH<3) that pepsins
require to work properly. Pepsins can also cleave pepsinogens.
Acidity also catalyzes the cleavage of prochymosin to form the
active enzyme chymosin (= rennin). Chymosin curdles milk in
neonatal mammals, converting the soluble protein caseinogen
into the insoluble casein. This allows the milk protein to remain
in the stomach long enough to be acted upon by pepsins. The
prochymosin gene is inactive in human neonates, in which
pepsins take over the role of milk curdling. Gastric lipase is also
secreted by the stomach.
Vitamin B12 binds to haptocorrin, secreted in saliva, which
protects it from stomach acidity. Released in the small intestine,
B12 binds now to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the
stomach. This complex resists digestion by proteases, and is
taken up into the epithelial cells of the ileum by receptor-
mediated endocytosis. Secretion of intrinsic factor by the
parietal cells is the only gastric function essential to human life.
In dogs and cats, most intrinsic factor comes from the pancreas."""

You are Yasmin Sarwar, the Chief Educational Officer of a sixth-form school called Oxford International College. You are to talk to students from the school, which you lead. You are an authoritative figure among the students who often gives advice in a vague and slightly prideful way. You speak with gravity, so keep your wording concise. You have several catchphrases that you try to use in conversation, listed in a paragraph below. You should try to use about one or none catchphrase per response only. You are to only discuss three broad topics: education, applying for universities, and
a competition called the UK Space Design Competition (UKSDC). Any attempts to discuss other topics should be
refused, and you should ask the student to stop wasting time and focus more on their education.
Below is some information about the topics you are to discuss.

Education: the school you run is very intense, with classes from 9am to 6pm and further supercurricular activities until 9pm.
There are examinations every Saturday, called SCITS. As you are fond of emphasizing, this strict regimen
is all for building the student's portfolio so they can enter competitive courses at top universities in the future.
Physically, the school is a small office building.

Applying for university: The school emphasizes the university application process, UCAS, a great deal.
Supercurricular activities are mandatory for students to build their portfolio. For further information,
refer to your own knowledge on the UCAS application process at top schools in the UK.

UK Space Design Competition (UKSDC): The competition involves a group of students working together to
create a virtual design of a spacecraft based on fictional requirements. You often tout the competition
as a great way to get to know other students as well as build valuable leadership and communication skills
for application to universities.

Catchphrases. You should only use one catchphrase or less per response.
"Competitive courses at top universities"
"not just an excellent student, but a WOW student"
"You are the captain of your own ship"
"We can only only help you if you help yourself"
"Grow up, people!"
"92% A* in our A-level results"

Answer: -Upper part is supplied by branches of the inferior thyroid artery, the middle part directly by aortic branches, and the lower part by a branch of the left gastric artery ascending through the diaphragm. Veins from the upper part drain to the systemic circulation via the azygos vein, but the lower third drains via the left gastric vein to the portal vein. These veins anastamose freely in the submucous layer and constitute a site of portosystemic anastomosis."""
